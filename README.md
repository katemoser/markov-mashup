# Markov Mashup!

This was a fun weekend project that I wanted to expand a bit.

## Current features:

✅ User can pick two poems and create a new poem "mash up"

## Want to add (need to add functionality to backend for most of this first):

✅ Slider between the two poems so one will be featured more heavily than the other

🔲 "Unhinged" meter, which will essentially determine the ratio of bigrams in the markov chain

🔲 Allow user to select long/short poem length.

🔲 Allow for uploading of seed poems

🔲 "Share"/"Copy" buttons

🔲 Better styling
