# Markov Mashup!

This was a fun weekend project that I wanted to expand a bit.

## Current features:

âœ… User can pick two poems and create a new poem "mash up"

## Want to add (need to add functionality to backend for most of this first):

âœ… Slider between the two poems so one will be featured more heavily than the other

âœ… Add in color coded text so you can see which words come from what seed

ðŸ”² "Unhinged" meter, which will essentially determine the ratio of bigrams in the markov chain

ðŸ”² Allow user to select long/short poem length.

ðŸ”² Allow for uploading of seed poems

ðŸ”² "Share"/"Copy" buttons

ðŸ”² Better styling
